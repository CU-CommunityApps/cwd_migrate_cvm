# File to Media Migration configuration for canine_image migration
# Please forgive the naming inconsistency. You know I *hate* leaving it like this, but I've already run this migration, and I'm trying SO HARD not to do any "optional" work (and if I rename it now, I'll have to undo/rerun some stuff, and, just, we only have 3-4 weeks left...), so instead, I'm writing a rambling code comment (faster than redoing it while still making me feel slightly better).
